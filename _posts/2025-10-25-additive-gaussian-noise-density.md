Adding independent Gaussian noise to any random variable—no matter its original form—ensures the result has a well-defined probability density.
In machine learning, this principle is used in generative probabilistic modeling trained by MLE to ensure a well-defined objective.
The note below explores the math behind this phenomenon and its practical implications: [pdf](/assets/study-notes/additive-gaussian-noise-density.pdf).
